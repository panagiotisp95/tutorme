“Knowledge is power” is a dictum in many countries that goes back to the English philosopher Francis Bacon. And that is exactly what our application is about. Affordable and easy transfer of knowledge on a human level without the necessity to be a highly educated, trained or certified person.
People might be “just” very talented or learned something over many years without a paper stating this.
In short, our platform allows users to share any kind of knowledge or skills with someone eager to learn it, and the app will do the matching. On top, the teaching-user can get even paid for it if he wishes so!
It's like tinder, only instead of exchanging physicality's, you exchange knowledge!
The learning-user can filter for a specific field that he wants to deepen his or her knowledge, and corresponding profiles are presented one after the other that provides the desired service. A simple "yes" or "no" decision is then made, and the teaching-user receives a notification that allows him to accept the offer and seal the deal.
Only when both users agree, the application will share each other's contact details. The future user will be able to register as a “teacher” or a “learner” or both. Registered teaching or learning users can each rate their counterpart after the service.
