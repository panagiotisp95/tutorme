            <p align="justify">"Knowledge is power" is a dictum in many countries that goes back to the English philospher Francis Bacon
                And that is exactly what TutorMe is about. Affordable and easy to transfer knowledge on a human level without
                the necessity to be a highly educated, trained or certified person.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Teach</strong> useful skills and share your experience</h3>
            <p align="justify">
                Perhaps you are an expert in a field and want to help people who don't have access to an official
                education system expand their knowledge and horizons. Or maybe, due to your work, experience and talents
                you have obtained useful skills, that potential sstudents might be interested in obtaining. In every case, if you enjoy
                teaching and want to help others, TutorMe allows you to share your knowledge with the community. And who knows? Maybe you'll get the chance to learn
                something new yourself!

            <h4>Is TutorMe free to use?</h4>
            <p align="justify">
                Yes! We want TutorMe to offer an alternative to what is usually expensive teaching methods, as helping people with
                different financial capabilities obtain knowledge is one of our core values. In the future, the website will offer teachers
                the opportunity to charge for their lessons, but the core of TutorMe will always remain free.
            </p>
            <h4>Do I need any certification?</h4>
            <p align="justify">
                No certification is needed! We believe that many skills can be learned in ways that do not neccesitate certifications, through life experience,
                self-teaching, side activities, and of course, tutoring. However, if you are certified in an area, that is a plus, and you can display such certifications on
                your teacher's profile.
            </p>
            <h4>Since no certification is needed, how can i trust the quality of the teaching?</h4>
            <p align="justify">
                The website features a rating system, that allows you to review your teacher. In addition, our team will be moderating the website to make sure
                that all the teachers and users are genuine. But since TutorMe's focus is on bringing people together, you are still expected to practice common sense when it comes
                to choosing and communicating with other users (teachers and learners). In every case, our team will work as hard as possible to make sure you have a quality and
                hassle-free experience on the website.
            </p>
            <h4>The category/skill that I want to learn is not on the website</h4>
            <p align="justify">
                Our team will be reguraly updating the categories list, to make sure you can learn and teach everything that you want to. We also expect the list to grow
                as more and more people join TutorMe. If you have a suggestion for a category/skill you want to learn or teach, please email us.
            </p>
            <h4>A teacher asked me for money in return for a lesson</h4>
            <p align="justify">
               As of right now, TutorMe is meant to be 100% free. Please send us the teacher's username and the email where he asks for compensation.
               In the future, we will add an optional payment option, that will be visible on the teacher's profile.
